# Pollango Django App

<em>See Documentation and tutorial references at:</em> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial02/

<h4>This is a simple Django polling app that demonstrates how to create and interact with `Question` and `Choice` models using Django's ORM. Below is an overview of some common actions you can perform.
</h4>
## Setting Up

### 1. Create a Question
You can create a new `Question` object by specifying the question text and the publication date.

```python
from django.utils import timezone
from polls.models import Question

# Create a new Question object.
q = Question(question_text="What's up?", pub_date=timezone.now())
q.save()
2. Querying the Question Model
Get all questions:

python
Copy
Question.objects.all()
Output:
<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>

Get the first question:

python
Copy
Question.objects.first()
Get the last question:

python
Copy
Question.objects.last()
Get a specific question by ID:

python
Copy
Question.objects.get(id=1)
3. Filtering Questions
Django provides a rich database lookup API that is driven by keyword arguments.

Get questions by specific criteria:

python
Copy
Question.objects.filter(id=1)
Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith="What")
Get questions published in the current year:

python
Copy
from django.utils import timezone
current_year = timezone.now().year
Question.objects.get(pub_date__year=current_year)
Error handling when a question ID doesnâ€™t exist:

python
Copy
Question.objects.get(id=2)  # Raises DoesNotExist exception
Using primary key (pk) shortcut for lookups:

python
Copy
Question.objects.get(pk=1)
4. Custom Methods
Django allows you to define custom methods on models. For instance, we define was_published_recently as a custom method for the Question model.

python
Copy
q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
q.was_published_recently()
Creating Choices for a Question
1. Adding Choices to a Question
You can associate Choice objects with a Question. Django provides a related object set (choice_set) to access the choices for a given question.

Creating choices:

python
Copy
q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)

# Create three choices.
q.choice_set.create(choice_text="Not much", votes=0)
q.choice_set.create(choice_text="The sky", votes=0)
c = q.choice_set.create(choice_text="Just hacking again", votes=0)
2. Accessing Related Choices
Once the choices are created, you can access them through the related object set.

python
Copy
# Display choices for the question.
q.choice_set.all()

# Count the number of choices for the question.
q.choice_set.count()
3. Accessing the Related Question from a Choice
Choices are related to a specific question, and you can access the related question like this:

python
Copy
# Access the related question from a choice object.
c.question
4. Querying Choices Based on Relationships
You can query Choice objects based on the properties of the related Question object.

python
Copy
Choice.objects.filter(question__pub_date__year=current_year)
5. Deleting Choices
To delete a choice, you can use the delete() method on a filtered queryset.

python
Copy
# Delete a choice.
c = q.choice_set.filter(choice_text__startswith="Just hacking")
c.delete()
Conclusion
This Django app demonstrates basic functionality for creating and interacting with questions and choices in a polling application. You can use the provided methods to filter, query, and manipulate the data stored in the database.
